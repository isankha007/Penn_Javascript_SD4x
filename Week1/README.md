# Homework 1 - HTML

In this assignment, you will be given the HTML for a page that uses inline "style" attributes within each HTML tag to display a calendar for a particular month, which includes some events that are color-coded, as well as other styling.

Your goal here is to modify the page so that it doesnâ€™t use any inline attributes at all, but instead include all CSS in a separate, external file.
