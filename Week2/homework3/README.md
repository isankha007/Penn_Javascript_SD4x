# Homework 3 - jQuery  

Develop a calculator app using JavaScript and jQuery.  

In this assignment, you do not need to modify the appearance of the calculator, you only need to implement the functionality of entering values and performing arithmetic operations using JavaScript in the web page and jQuery to access the HTML elements.

Write the JavaScript code using jQuery to implement the calculator functionality. Your calculator should work as a “normal” calculator would be expected to operate.
